# Description texts
senti_text = """The visualizations for the sentiment analysis of your WhatsApp chat data provide insights into the emotional tone of the group conversations:

Distribution of Sentiment Polarity:

This histogram shows the frequency distribution of polarity scores across all messages. Polarity scores range from -1 (very negative) to +1 (very positive), with scores
around 0 indicating neutral sentiment. The shape of the distribution can give an idea of the overall positivity or negativity of the group's conversations.

Average Sentiment Polarity per Day:

This line plot shows the average sentiment polarity for each day. Fluctuations in this plot indicate changes in the group's overall mood on a day-to-day basis.
Peaks (high values) suggest days with more positive conversations, while troughs (low values) indicate days with more negative sentiments. These visualizations are
essential for understanding the emotional dynamics of the group over time and can be particularly insightful when correlated with specific events or topics
discussed in the group."""


topic_text = """This code performs the following steps:

Preprocesses the text data by tokenizing, converting to lowercase, removing non-alphabetic tokens, and filtering out stopwords. Creates a dictionary and
corpus needed for LDA topic modeling. Runs the LDA model to discover topics in the chat data. Displays the top words associated with each topic.
The output will be a set of topics, each represented by a set of words that are most significant to that topic. This can help you understand the main
themes of discussion in your WhatsApp group chat."""


emoji_text ="""Most Common Emojis: The list and bar chart of the most common emojis give a quick insight into the prevalent moods and reactions in the
group chat. For example, a preponderance of laughter or smiley emojis might suggest a generally light-hearted and positive group atmosphere.

Emoji Usage Patterns: By examining which emojis are most frequently used, you can infer the group's general mood and preferences. For instance:

Frequent use of hearts and smiley faces might indicate a friendly and positive interaction style. Use of surprise or shock emojis could imply
frequent sharing of surprising or unexpected news. Contextual Analysis: For a deeper understanding, consider the context in which these emojis are
used. This could involve analyzing the text surrounding the emoji usage to interpret the sentiments more accurately."""




forecasting_text = """Historical Message Counts (Blue Line): This represents the actual number of messages sent in the group for each time point in your
historical data. The spikes indicate days with a high number of messages, which could be due to specific events or conversations that engaged many members of the group.

Predicted Message Counts (Red Line): This shows the predicted number of messages based on the linear regression model. It appears as a flat line because
a simple linear regression model doesn't capture the variability or seasonality in the data; it only predicts the average trend.

Here's how to interpret the graph:

The blue line's spikes and troughs represent the natural variability in how many messages are sent each day. Some days are busier than others. The red line's
flatness indicates that the linear regression model predicts that, on average, the future will continue with the same average message count as the historical mean.
It does not predict the ups and downs because it's not a time-series model that captures patterns over time. For more accurate forecasting, especially for
time series data like this, you might consider using models that can account for seasonality, trends, and irregular cycles, such as ARIMA, SARIMA, or even LSTM networks
for deep learning approaches.

It's also worth noting that the linear model will not capture any potential future events that could cause spikes in messaging - it assumes the future will be like
the past, on average."""


word_cloud_text = """How to Interpret the Output: Word Clouds:

The size of each word in the word cloud indicates its frequency in the chat. Larger words were mentioned more frequently, highlighting the key themes or
subjects that dominate the group's conversations. It gives a quick visual representation of the most discussed topics. Trending Topics (Not included in the
code but typically involves Topic Modeling):

Trending topics analysis would identify the main themes or topics in the chat over time. Each topic would be represented by a set of words that frequently
occur together. By analyzing how the prominence of these topics changes over time, you can understand shifts in the group's focus or interest."""
